     <div class="letra">On March 13th 2007, American gothic metal band TYPE O NEGATIVE released their seventh and final studio album, Dead Again. This year marks the 15th anniversary of the band's final record before the passing of bassist/vocalist Peter Steele.<p></p>
 
Today, the band announces that they are offering a limited edition re-issue of Dead Again.<p></p>
 
TYPE O NEGATIVE's Kenny Hickey comments,<p></p>
 
"The first casualty of this album was the record company - which promptly went under after its release. Soon after, Peter passed, and then even the rehearsal studio it was written and developed in was burnt to the ground by Hurricane Sandy. As the black cloud continued its relentless path over TYPE O, Dead Again appeared and disappeared from the streaming platforms for years. Now that the storm has passed, we have some slight hope of establishing a small illusion of permanence with this final release of Dead Again. We are sorry for any inconvenience we may have caused you."<p></p>
